# Staying Up-to-Date
tag: [Security Specialist, Operations & Strategy]

It is often very valuable to have information on the latest security threats and trends, as you may be able to take preventive actions for attacks that are increasing, or security vulnerabilities that may be relevant to your project. Some things you could consider doing are:

## 1. Subscribe to Security Newsletters

- **Industry News**: While most security newsletters are focused on web2, they could still be relevant to your project as a large part is actually likely to run on web2 services. You could subscribe to newsletters from sources such as FIRST.org.
- **Vendor Updates**: If you have awareness of what software and hardware you're running in your project stack (which you should), you can follow updates from them for information on new vulnerabilities and patches.

## 2. Participate in Security Communities

- **Forums and Groups**: Join online groups dedicated to security topics, such as the SEAL Discord.
- **Local Meetups**: Attend local security meetups and conferences such as Defi Security Summit to network with other professionals and learn about what's new in security.

## 3. Follow Security Blogs and Podcasts

- **Social Feeds**: Follow blogs and listen to podcasts such as the Daily Stormcast from FIRST.org or Darknet Diaries to gain deeper insights into emerging threats and solutions.
